1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
-var is function-scoped and can be redeclared, let is block-scoped and reassignable, while const is block-scoped but can’t be reassigned.
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
-map() returns a new array of transformed values, forEach() just loops without returning, and filter() returns a new array with only items that pass a condition.
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
-Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for functions and they don’t bind their own this.
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
-It lets you unpack values from arrays or objects directly into variables in a concise way.
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
-Template literals use backticks (`) and allow embedded expressions (${}) and multi-line strings, unlike + concatenation.
